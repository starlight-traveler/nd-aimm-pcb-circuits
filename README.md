This will be periodically updated with Alitum files, all repositories are usually pushed to the Alitum365 or git reversion server on the Alitum side, not to here. Usually any files from Alitum will need to be pushed manually.

Please sign up here for Altium student edition:

Once you are in Alitum, have it downloaded, etc, please go through this tutorial to make your first PCB in Alitum, note: please do not try and submit this via reversion.

Once you have accomplished the above, then join the Notre Dame Altium repository, you will need to contact the Adminsitrator (usually Lead Officer for access) and check your email. Alitum does require a bit of compute to run, but should run on most modern computers.
